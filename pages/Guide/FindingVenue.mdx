# Locking Down a Venue

Securing the right venue is one of the most critical steps in planning a successful Make-A-Ton. It often takes longer than expected to finalize a location, so start scouting early. A confirmed venue demonstrates your commitment to potential sponsors and participants.

## Choosing the Right Venue

Make-A-Ton has its unique challenges when it comes to venue selection, especially if the focus extends beyond software into hardware innovation or interdisciplinary projects. Here’s how to approach it:

### Campus Venues

On-campus venues are ideal because they are usually **free**. Check the following:

- **Past Events:** Identify venues used for similar events and evaluate their suitability.
- **University Bureaucracy:** Most venues have a single authority overseeing them. Find out who this is and connect early.
- **Student Referrals:** Ask organizers of past events for advice on securing your preferred venue.

### Current Options in Cusat

- Seminar Complex(200)
- Placment Hall, SOE(200)
- Polymer Auditorium(150+)
- SMS Auditorium(150+)

### Administrative Challenges

Booking a venue on campus often involves navigating bureaucracy. Having a middlemen (who has connections with authorities) can make this process smoother. This could be a professor, dean, or advisor. If you’re recruiting a new advocate, pitch your Make-A-Ton clearly.

- **Define Make-A-Ton:** Present Make-A-Ton in way that aligns with their interests and benefits. Like how it boosts the image of university rather than the legacy of this event(They don't care)
- **Provide Visuals:** Share photos, videos, or examples of past successful events.
- **Highlight Benefits:** Emphasize how the event benefits students (e.g., skill development, exposure to industry trends, or networking).
- **Align with Goals:** Relate the event to the school’s mission, like fostering innovation or enhancing recruitment opportunities.

## When Campus Venues Are Challenging

There are rare instances when campus venues may become unavailable, such as during visits from high-profile figures (e.g., a Chief Minister or VIP). If this happens, explore alternatives:

### External Venues

Consider off-campus locations like coworking spaces or event halls. **Book early, especially during wedding seasons**, as venues tend to fill up quickly.Here are some options in Cochin:

- KSUM

For external venues:

- **Pitch Professionally:** Provide a concise description of your event, similar to what you’d share with campus authorities.
- **Highlight Benefits:** Explain how hosting your event benefits their space, such as attracting foot traffic or aligning with their community initiatives.
- **Avoid Costs:** Negotiate for free use or sponsorship rather than paying outright. Paying for a venue can significantly increase your budget and logistical challenges.
