# Finding the Date & Theme

The first step in planning Make-A-Ton is deciding **when** and **what theme** your event will revolve around. Make-A-Ton has been primarily about innovation, but the theme can vary based on your goals and audience.

## Event Length

Determine the ideal duration of Make-A-Ton. From the past years, the hackathon normally begin on a Friday evening or Saturday morning and concludes with a closing ceremony by Sunday evening.

> **Note:** For partnerships like MLH Member Events, your event must take place over a weekend (earliest start: Friday evening; latest end: Sunday afternoon).

## Finding the Date

After finalizing your theme, the next step is to pick a date. Keep these factors in mind:

### 1. Major Events in Your College

Avoid scheduling your Make-A-Ton on dates that overlap with major events at the College. This helps maximize attention and attendance.Here are the possible Events that might clash:

- TedxCusat Event
- SpaceUp Unconference
- Political Party events

### 2. Holidays and Festivals

Consider cultural factors:

- Hosting events near holidays or festivals can increase participation, as people are often more available and enthusiastic.
- However, avoid scheduling too close to major holidays, which may conflict with personal or family plans.

### 3. University Breaks

Long breaks can reduce attendance, as students might pursue internships or travel. Shorter breaks are ideal for hosting a weekend Make-A-Ton, potentially boosting turnout.

### 4. Competing Hackathons or Events

Check the schedule of other hackathons or other Club events in your area. Overlapping dates may lead to reduced participation and competition for your target audience. Some of the events are:

- IEDC Summit
- Huddle Global
- GDG Cochin Events(devfest,community day)
- Techfest/Hackathon in NIT,CET,GEC Thrissur,MEC,MACE etc.

### 5. Exam Schedules

Most participants are students, so consider exam periods carefully. Scheduling your event after exams increases attendance and engagement.

> **Tip for Organizers:** Leave enough time after exams to finalize your plans and deliver your best effort for the event.
